Q10: Assign a 'birthday_this_year' column to the customer table where each customer has a birthday associated with them in the yyyy-mm-dd format.
Let c_id = 1 have birthday '2020-01-01', then let the next customer c_id = 2 have a birthday 1 days later than that the birthday of c_id = 1.
Continue in this way such that customer c_id = 3 has their birthday 2 days later than the birthday of c_id = 2 and so on.
Finally, customer c_id = 9 will have their birthday 8 days later than the birthday of c_id = 8.
